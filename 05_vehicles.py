"""
You are tasked with developing a system to manage different types of vehicles.
The system should include various types of vehicles such as cars, trucks, and motorcycles.
Each type of vehicle shares some common attributes but also has specific attributes
  and behaviors unique to its type.
You will need multiple classes to accomplish this,
  with some classes inheriting from a parent class.
See example:

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020, 4)
truck = Truck("Ford", "F-150", 2018, 10000)
motorcycle = Motorcycle("Harley-Davidson", "Sportster", 2019, "Cruiser")

print(car.get_info())         # Prints car information
print(truck.get_info())       # Prints truck information
print(motorcycle.get_info())  # Prints motorcycle information


Once your classes are complete, copy and paste the above example below them in order to test their functionality.
